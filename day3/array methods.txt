The join() 
method creates and returns a new string by concatenating all of the elements in an array

he some()
 method tests whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function


 he sort()
  method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the reference to the same array, now sorted.
   The default sort order is ascending, built upon converting the elements into strings, then comparing their sequences of UTF-16 code units values.


   entries()
Return value A new Array iterator objec>>>the use iterator to retrieve elements



he Array.from() 
static method creates a new, shallow-copied Array instance from an iterable or array-like object.
ex >>>>console.log(Array.from('foo'));
// Expected output: Array ["f", "o", "o"]



The fill()
 method changes all elements in an array to a static value, from a start index (default 0) to an end index (default array.length). It returns the modified array.


 The flat() 
 method creates a new array with all sub-array elements concatenated into it recursively up to the specified depth.


 The at()
  method takes an integer value and returns the item at that index,
   allowing for positive and negative integers. Negative integers count back from the last item in the array
